please write the section related to the sol lewitt wall drawings, specifying: 
- a brief history of the work, including the exact instructions for Sol LeWitt Wall Drawing #118
- a discussion of all of the different practitioners involved.
- a comment that you can look to the opposite page and see a rendition of this work (though with 22 points, instead of 50), and though it is rendered with a pen plotter rather than a human working on a wall. however, there was a human who programmed the pen plotter. Discuss a little bit about how this version then is different from the wall version.
- discuss for a minute about how the copyright system disenfranchises the actual individuals who create the art Sol LeWitt creates, and how the "mechanical reproduction" guideline outlined by the copyright office is a hazy guideline.
- in the context of my proposal to Break apart copyright authorship into a percentage allocation system, where each entity involved (human or non-human) responsible gains a partial ownership of the art, discuss how the work could be allocated (maybe 70% sol, 30% artisans)

this will need to be just 1 page, so please keep it to 3 paragraphs, thank you!
