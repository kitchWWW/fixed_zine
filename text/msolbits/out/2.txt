**Sol LeWitt Wall Drawing #118: Disentangling Authorship**

Sol LeWitt, a pioneer of conceptual art, first exhibited his breakthrough wall drawings in the late 1960s. These works are built upon a simple, yet profound philosophy: "The idea becomes a machine that makes the art." Wall Drawing #118, created in 1971, exemplifies this approach. The instructions read: “On a wall surface, any continuous stretch of wall, using a hard pencil, place fifty points at random. The points should be evenly distributed throughout the area. All of the points should be connected by straight lines.” These enigmatic instructions invite a collaborative and interpretative engagement from everyone involved. Artisans and performers translate these conceptual blueprints into tangible artworks, with each rendition varying slightly due to the unique wall space and the specific individuals involved in its creation.

The translators of LeWitt’s visions—the artisans—play a vital role in manifesting his ideas into reality. These practitioners are tasked with interpreting the written concepts, making aesthetic judgments, and bringing them to life on physical surfaces. Unlike traditional artists who work individually within the confines of their studios, LeWitt's wall drawings demand collective effort. This collaborative installation process, involving artisans following LeWitt's directives, results in unique interactions of human intention and machine-like precision. This exemplifies Michel Edwards' notion of "a machine that makes the art," capturing the essence of procedural and chance art. On the opposite page, you'll see a rendition of Wall Drawing #118 executed by a pen plotter. This machine, guided by human-programmed commands, executes the same principles on paper with 22 points rather than 50, showcasing a marriage of human instruction and mechanical execution. This interplay highlights the multifaceted nature of authorship within conceptual art.

The copyright system often overlooks these intricate collaborations by predominantly recognizing LeWitt as the sole author. The artisans, integral to the artwork's creation, remain largely invisible in legal terms. The “mechanical reproduction” framework espoused by copyright laws further muddies the waters, as it fails to encapsulate the nuanced, ephemeral nature of such collaborative processes. In light of my proposal to break apart copyright authorship into a percentage allocation system, we could consider attributing 70% of the work's copyright to LeWitt for his conceptual genesis and 30% to the artisans for their interpretive execution. This would better honor the diverse voices and hands contributing to the realization of LeWitt's visionary art. Such a shift could empower those who breathe life into conceptual frameworks, aligning copyright practices with the collaborative spirit of contemporary artistic processes.
