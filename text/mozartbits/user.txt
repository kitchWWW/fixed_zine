i am writing a short section about Mozart’s “Musikalisches Würfelspiel” (Musical Dice Games) as a part of this work:

please write the section related to mozart, specifying: 
- a sentence or two about the history of the work
- a sentence or two about how the peace actually is performed (with dice, the chart, etc.)
- be sure to call out that the outputs seen on the opposing page (two of them will be included next to this paragraph) show examples of mozarts process (repeating the last two measures of the phrase identically no matter what, etc.)

- a short discussion on the copyright that would be in discussion here. Obviously the peace has been written a very long time ago, so it is not protected under copyright anymore, but if it was made today, the actual scores that you see off to the side would not be protected under copyright, only the originating source material such as the code or score fragments. This then leaves the copyrighted nature of the individual pieces that get performed in limbo.
- please end with a point that the outputs are 'unfixed' and ever changing, multitudinous in their existence. (bold the 'unfixed' word, since it is the title of the zine)

lastly, in the context of my proposal to break apart copyright authorship into a percentage allocation system, where each entity involved (human or non-human) responsible gains a partial ownership of the art, analyze how the waltz might be allocated: 80% mozart, 20% human. I think it is important to note here that the dice actually play no role. Every opportunity they could possibly have is accounted for by Mozart, and therefore entirely captured within his portion. and the player, as the performer to bring the work to life, gets credited duly for their smaller but imperative portion.

this will need to be just 1 page, so don't include more than three paragraphs please! thank you!
