### Playing Data

**Playing Data** is an innovative collection of algorithmically generated graphic scores that thrive on the exploration of chaos, absurdity, and the digitized human pursuit of knowledge. Each score, characterized by gestural lines, figures, and shapes, can be performed solo or by an ensemble possessing the specific NFT related to the work. These unique NFTs are available on OpenSea, initially priced at around $15 USD, with student discounts offered. Pricing adjustments will be made if Ethereum values rise significantly to ensure the offerings remain accessible. The graphic elements within each score originate from machine learning datasets, prompting performers and observers alike to seek meaning in the presented chaos.

In the realm of creative coding, artists frequently utilize stock images or vast datasets, making it challenging to properly credit all contributors. This scenario is common, as creators often rely on pre-existing visual materials as foundational elements within new creations, yet specific attributions are obscured amidst the intertwining of inputs and outputs. This state of affairs highlights the complexities and current limitations within the copyright system, which does not accommodate the multifaceted nature of digital creativity resulting from collaborative and algorithmic processes. Credit allocation becomes a convoluted task, hindered by the impractical nature of tracing individual creators in a sea of interconnected data.

In line with my proposal to restructure copyright authorship into a percentage allocation system, Playing Data offers a compelling case study. Within this framework, ownership of the artistic output could be distributed equitably among all contributors to the work's creation. For instance, I, as the primary creator, might take a 40% ownership stake, while the remaining 60% could be divided among the numerous artists, individuals, and designers whose work is woven into the final piece, including patient data contributors and Google Map designers. This method emphasizes shared creative ownership and aligns with modern collaborative art making practices, recognizing and valuing all participating voices, both human and non-human.
