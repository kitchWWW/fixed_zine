### Playing Data: Navigating Authorship in Algorithmic Art

**Summary**  
Playing Data is a pioneering collection of algorithmically generated graphic scores, each rich with gestural lines, figures, and shapes. These scores, devised to evoke chaos, absurdity, and the human-computer interplay for comprehension, can be performed by any soloist or ensemble currently possessing the corresponding NFT. Each piece, minted at an approximate price of $15 USD per NFT, employs images drawn from machine learning datasets, inviting observers to extract their personal interpretations. Currently hosted on OpenSea, these NFTs aim to maintain accessibility through student discounts and potential price revisions should Ethereum values surge.

**The Challenge of Creative Ownership**  
In the realm of creative coding, practitioners often utilize stock images and large datasets, presenting unique challenges in appropriately crediting each individual creator. The vast digital landscapes from which these images are drawn—for instance, open-access stock photo platforms, medical imaging resources, or even Google Maps—are repositories of innumerable creative contributions. As AI and machine learning rely on massive datasets, the intertwining of myriad creative works renders precise authorship attribution nearly impossible. This conundrum reflects a broader issue within digital art: ensuring just recognition and compensation for all contributors.

**A Proposal for Equitable Authorship**  
With my proposal to fragment copyright authorship into a percentage allocation system, Playing Data's authorship could offer a fair distribution of ownership—40% allocated to myself as the orchestrator and visionary behind the project, while the remaining 60% is distributed among the assorted creators of the images that enrich my work. Within this model, photographers, cartographers, and countless other creatives whose works have been inadvertently integrated would share in the recognition and potential profits. This reimagined authorship structure would acknowledge the significant roles both human and machine-driven inputs play in the process of creation, promoting not only fairness but also an evolution in how we perceive collaborative artistic production.
