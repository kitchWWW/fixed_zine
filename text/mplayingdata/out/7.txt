**Playing Data** is an innovative project that presents a collection of algorithmically generated graphic scores, rich with gestural lines, figures, and shapes. Designed for performance by any soloist or ensemble that holds the corresponding NFT, these scores aim to evoke the chaotic and often absurd quest for understanding that is inherent to both human and computerized exploration. The NFTs are available on OpenSea, with an initial minting price of approximately $15 USD, keeping accessibility in mind by offering student discounts. In cases where fluctuations in Ethereum prices render these NFTs out of reach, the pricing strategy is set to be revisited, ensuring that the 0.005 ETH price point remains inclusive.

In the realm of creative coding, it is commonplace to draw from vast collections of stock images or large datasets, which complicates efforts to attribute credit accurately to the original creators. Many datasets, such as those used in machine learning, amalgamate inputs from a dizzying array of sources, resulting in a final product that is inherently collaborative. The ownership of creative works thus becomes a complex question of attribution and recognition, as the labyrinthine origins of each element entangle the credits due to artists, image subjects, and even the creators of the datasets themselves. Playing Data acknowledges this complexity by inviting performers and audiences alike to derive their interpretations, further weaving their own understanding into the quilt of collective creativity.

In light of these challenges, my proposal to break apart copyright authorship into a percentage allocation system aligns with the vision behind Playing Data. In this system, creative responsibility—and therefore ownership—would be divided among all entities involved, be they human or algorithmic. For Playing Data, I propose allocating 40% ownership to myself as the creator who aggregated and formed the final texture and narrative of the piece. The remaining 60% could be distributed among the multitude of contributors: visual artists whose work populates stock image libraries, individuals captured incidentally by Google's mapping services, and countless anonymous contributors whose data is parsed by machine learning algorithms. This model not only reflects the interconnected nature of modern creativity but also honors the myriad influences that shape our digital expressions.
