### Playing Data

"Playing Data" is a collection of algorithmically generated graphic scores, each designed with gestural lines, figures, and shapes to be performed by any soloist or ensemble possessing the NFT of the particular work. These scores are meant to embody chaos, absurdity, and the intersection of human and computer efforts to seek understanding. The images in the scores derive from machine learning datasets, inviting performers and observers to find meaning within them. Hosted on OpenSea, each NFT is priced around $15 USD at the time of minting, with student discounts available. If Ethereum prices rise significantly, I plan to reassess the 0.005 ETH price point to ensure accessibility.

In creative coding, it is common to source materials from stock images or large datasets, such as satellite images, public domain artworks, or medical imaging. These sources enhance creative projects by offering vast visual elements to draw from. However, crediting the myriad creators involved in producing these datasets is often impractical, given the number of contributors and the limitations of metadata in datasets. This reality highlights a significant opportunity for a nuanced approach to copyright that acknowledges the contributions from diverse sources.

In light of my proposal to "break apart copyright authorship into a percentage allocation system," each entity involved in this creative process, whether human or non-human, could claim a share of ownership. In the case of Playing Data, perhaps I, as the creator of the algorithm and curator of the process, could hold 40% authorship. The remaining 60% could be distributed among the artists, patients, and designers whose contributions, although indirectly, shape the work. This system could bring a more equitable recognition to the collaborative and intertwined nature of contemporary creative practices.
