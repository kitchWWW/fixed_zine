**Playing Data and Distributed Creative Authorship**

*Playing Data* is a novel art collection of algorithmically generated graphic scores crafted to provoke thought and reflection on the complex interplay between chaos, absurdity, and the human quest for understanding in a computerized world. Each piece, embedded within an NFT, is available through platforms like OpenSea, allowing current owners exclusive performance rights. With a minting price set at roughly $15 USD, flexible payment options are available to ensure accessibility, especially for students. Adjustments are promised in response to fluctuations in Ethereum prices, affirming a commitment to inclusivity and affordability.

In the realm of creative coding, the reliance on stock images and expansive datasets is widespread, enabling the fusion of disparate images into cohesive artworks. However, this practice inherently complicates the attribution process, as distinguishing all contributing creators becomes an overwhelming task. The use of diverse data sources, ranging from machine learning datasets to stock images, situates *Playing Data* at the intersection of modern digital art and traditional notions of artistic authorship and authority.

Proposed is a reimagined framework of copyright ownership that adapts to such collaborative and data-intensive art forms. Breaking apart the notion of singular authorship, a percentage allocation system recognizes the myriad contributors to a work. For *Playing Data*, this could mean designating 40% ownership to myself as the principal creator and distributor of the project, with the remaining 60% smartly divided among the diverse creators who indirectly contribute â€” from stock image photographers and patients, to Google Maps designers. This method fosters a more equitable distribution of credit and compensation, embracing a modern approach to authorship that better reflects the interconnected nature of art in the digital age.
