**Playing Data: Exploring Creative Coding and Collaborative Authorship**

*Playing Data* is a groundbreaking collection of algorithmically generated graphic scores, each intricately filled with gestural line, figure, and shape. Designed for performance by any soloist or ensemble in possession of the corresponding NFT, these scores invite musical exploration while capturing the chaos and absurdity inherent in the computerized, yet deeply human, quest for understanding. Each graphic element within these scores is drawn from machine learning datasets, challenging observers to search for meaning and interpretation within the overlapping visual narratives. Currently hosted on OpenSea, these NFTs minted at approximately $15 USD underscore the potential of digital ownership, with flexible pricing to ensure accessibility amid fluctuating Ethereum values.

In the realm of creative coding, the reliance on stock images or expansive datasets is commonplace, presenting significant challenges in attributing proper credit to the original creators. The vast web of contributors—ranging from individual photographers, artists, and anonymous creators, to companies or entities like Google Maps—often becomes obscured, making precise credit allocation nearly impossible. This aspect of creative coding forces us to reconsider traditional notions of authorship and ownership. It highlights a persistent issue within digital art creation: the entangled, often untraceable contributions of numerous individuals and automated processes that blend into a seamless whole.

Amid this complex landscape, my proposal to break apart copyright authorship into a percentage allocation system aims to recognize the multifaceted nature of creative output. In *Playing Data,* I envision assigning 40% of the authorship to myself as the primary creator, responsible for orchestrating and conceptualizing the overarching work. The remaining 60% would be distributed among the myriad contributors: the individual artists, photographers, patients captured in medical datasets, and engineers behind mapping technologies whose inputs, knowingly or unknowingly, enrich and shape this artistic endeavor. This equitable distribution not only respects the complexity of digital art creation but also acknowledges the collaborative, albeit indirect, nature of crafting meaning in the digital age.
