### Playing Data: Exploring Algorithmic Creativity and Ownership

"Playing Data" is a unique collection of algorithmically generated graphic scores, designed to be performed by any soloist or ensemble possessing the NFT linked to the specific work. These scores, available on the OpenSea marketplace, are crafted to evoke chaos, absurdity, and the computerized, yet inherently human, quest for understanding. Each score is filled with gestural lines, figures, and shapes derived from machine learning datasets, challenging observers to glean meaning from them. While the initial minting price is approximately $15 USD (or 0.005 ETH), student discounts are available. Importantly, there is a commitment to reassess pricing should Ethereum's value surge, ensuring accessibility is maintained.

In the realm of creative coding, it is common practice to utilize stock images or extensive datasets to fuel creative endeavors. Such resources are invaluable for pushing the boundaries of digital art; however, they bring ethical and logistical challenges, primarily the difficulty of crediting all contributors appropriately. The vast, often public, repositories of data make it nearly impossible to discern and acknowledge every individual artist, patient, or designer whose work contributes to these datasets. This dilemma is emblematic of broader issues within the digital art world, where the ease of access to data often conflicts with traditional notions of authorship and credit.

To address this, my proposal suggests breaking apart copyright authorship into a percentage allocation system, ensuring every responsible entity—human or non-human—receives partial ownership of the art. For "Playing Data," a potential allocation could involve assigning 40% of the authorship to myself, as the creator orchestrating the work's conceptual and technical framework. The remaining 60% would be distributed among the myriad contributors whose images and data inform the scores. This would include individual artists, patients whose medical imaging might form part of the dataset, and designers of platforms like Google Maps that influence visual datasets. Such a model not only acknowledges the collaborative nature of modern creative processes but also ensures a more equitable distribution of recognition and control in the creation and use of digital artworks.
