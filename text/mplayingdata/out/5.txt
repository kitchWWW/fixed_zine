### Playing Data: A Collaborative Conundrum

"Playing Data" is an innovative collection of algorithmically generated graphic scores designed to be performed by any soloist or ensemble that owns the NFT associated with each specific work. These scores, priced initially at approximately $15 USD, are available on OpenSea and reflect an exploration into chaos, absurdity, and the pursuit of understanding within the digital realm. The scores are created from machine learning datasets and challenge observers and performers to uncover meaning within seemingly random lines, figures, and shapes. The pricing strategy is mindful of fluctuating Ethereum prices, offering student discounts and readiness to adjust listings in response to market dynamics.

In the realm of creative coding, sourcing from vast image databases or stock images is common practice, yet it often poses a challenge for crediting and acknowledging all contributors. Whether visual material is drawn from Google Maps, stock photography, or medical datasets, the collaborative nature of such digital art forms complicates traditional notions of authorship and ownership. This lack of transparent crediting is not merely a logistical oversight but a fundamental flaw in existing copyright and artistic recognition systems. How does one appropriately credit the myriad anonymous creators who contribute to these massive datasets yet remain invisibly tethered to their output?

To navigate these complexities, my proposal suggests a restructured copyright authorship system relying on a percentage allocation model. This would see artistic ownership distributed among all contributing entitiesâ€”explicitly acknowledging both human and non-human influences on the creative process. In the case of "Playing Data," I could maintain a 40% authorship for my contributions as the orchestrator of these complex visuals, while the remaining 60% could be distributed among the unseen artists, photographers, and map designers whose works inform the dataset. This fractioned approach not only honors the collaborative essence inherent in much of today's digital and algorithmic art-making but also ensures equitable recognition and potential compensation tied to the evolving artwork's life cycle.
