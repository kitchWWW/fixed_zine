**Playing Data: Navigating Authorship in Algorithmically Generated Art**

"Playing Data" is a collection of algorithmically generated graphic scores intended for performance by soloists or ensembles who own the corresponding NFT for each work. Each score is imbued with gestural lines, figures, and shapes, designed to evoke chaos, absurdity, and the human-like pursuit of understanding within the computerized realm. All visual elements within the scores are derived from machine learning datasets, inviting observers to seek meaning amid the chaos. These NFTs are accessible on OpenSea, initially valued at approximately $15 USD per mint. Understanding the fluctuating nature of cryptocurrency, provisions are made for student discounts and a promise to reassess pricing should Ethereum values soar, ensuring continued accessibility at the 0.005 ETH benchmark.

In creative coding, it is common practice to draw upon stock images or vast datasets; a method that, while effective, complicates the attribution of credit to innumerable creators embedded within these sources. The intertwining of myriad influences and the sheer volume of content make the task of appropriately crediting each contributor a near impossibility. This is particularly relevant in the field of generative art, where each line or form may owe its existence to countless anonymous sources, amplifying the conversation around authorship and ownership in digital creativity.

In my proposal to redefine copyright authorship as a percentage allocation system—where every entity involved, human or non-human, shares partial ownership—the division of "Playing Data" could be rationally approached. I suggest claiming 40% ownership for my role as the creator, programmer, and driver of the project. The remaining 60% could be distributed among the much larger network of unseen contributors, including the artists, patients, and Google Map designers whose images subtly shape the artwork. This distribution respects the collaborative nature of the work without trivializing the individual contributions that collectively drive its essence, offering a fairer balance between the creator and the unseen co-creators within the digital landscape.
