please write the section related to the monkey selfies, specifying: 

- a sentence or two about the history of david's work with the monkeys, his photography practice, and how he went about setting up the scenario for the monkey selfie to take off.
- a sentence or two about the controversy around it. discuss wikimedia, the claim of it with a non-human creator, etc. probably good to mention peta, etc.

- a short summary of how the legal cases went. include what the actual court decision was, as well as varying legal scholars opinions on what should have actually happened instead of the decision that was made.

- discuss the emotional and logistical toll that this has resulted in for David, and the lost income, and the reverberative effects that this has had on stifling other similar forms of art.

in the context of my proposal that copyright authorship be broken into a percentage allocation system, where each entity involved (human or non-human) responsible gains a partial ownership of the art, analyze how the waltz might be allocated: 50% david, 50% monkey. This would recognize that David can still profit from this work, while portions of it should be allocated elsewhere.

- please end concluding sentence as the point that the outputs of the process established by david are 'unfixed' , multitudinous in their possibilities until the monkey comes along and snaps them into reality. (bold the 'unfixed' word, since it is the title of the zine)

this will need to be just 1 page, so don't include more than three paragraphs please! thank you!
